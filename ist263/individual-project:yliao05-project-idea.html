    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>As a super fan of Sheriff Woody from the Toy Story series, I believe this project creates an irreplaceable opportunity to help people learn about Woody. Thus, I decided to build five pages on the final website including the introduction of Woody's background, personality, allies and enemies, quotes, and his journey on each film. 
    </p>
    <p>In detail, I would get my text content mostly from disney.fandom.com and disney.com because they cover precise information of Woody. More importantly, their original content can be used for noncommercial purposes. For images and videos, I would refer to official websites such as pixar.com and imdb.com.
