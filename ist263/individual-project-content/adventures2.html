When Woody and Buzz are suddenly trapped in the house of Andy's toy-killing neighbor Sid Phillips and his vicious dog Scud, they must work together to escape if they ever want to return to Andy’s house.</p>

                <p>Woody has always been confident about his place in the world and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that is Andy or Bonnie. But when Bonnie adds a reluctant new toy called “Forky” to her room, a road trip adventure alongside old and new friends will show Woody how big the world can be for a toy. Along the way, Woody is reunited with Bo Peep. Knowing he likely will not ever be Bonnie's favorite, and with Buzz supporting him, Woody decides not to return to Bonnie and to instead depart with Bo on her mission to help lost toys get adopted by children.</p>
